This is a repository based off of https://github.com/DaveBben/esp32-llm, the goal of which is to run a performant and capable language model off of the esp-32. 

A lot of the inspiration and changes were taken from that repo, and the main code to run it was taken from this repo: https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c
